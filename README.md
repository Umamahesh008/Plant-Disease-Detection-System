# 🌱 Plant Disease Detection System 🌿
# 📌 Overview
This project is an AI-powered Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture. Using a deep learning model, the system identifies plant diseases from images and provides predictions to help farmers and agricultural experts take preventive measures.

# 🚀 Features
Image Upload: Users can upload plant images for disease detection.
Deep Learning Model: A trained TensorFlow/Keras model classifies plant diseases.
Streamlit Web App: Provides an intuitive UI for easy interaction.
Wide Range of Diseases: Identifies multiple plant diseases across different crops.
Instant Results: Provides quick predictions with a user-friendly interface.

# 🏗️ Tech Stack
Frontend: Streamlit
Backend: TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy
Model: Pretrained deep learning model for image classification.
# 🔧 Setup & Installation
# Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Umamahesh008/Plant-Disease-Detection.git
cd Plant-Disease-Detection.
# Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Run the application:
streamlit run main.py
Upload an image and get predictions!
# 📝 How It Works
The user uploads an image of a plant leaf.
The image is preprocessed and passed to the trained deep learning model.
The model predicts the disease and displays the result.
The UI highlights the detected disease with a success message.
# 📜 Labels Supported
The model recognizes various plant diseases, including:

Apple Scab, Black Rot, Cedar Apple Rust
Corn Leaf Spot, Rust, Blight
Grape Black Rot, Esca (Black Measles), Leaf Blight
Potato Early & Late Blight
Tomato Bacterial Spot, Early Blight, Leaf Mold, Mosaic Virus
... and many more!
